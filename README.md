## Overview

The Configure 8 theme began under a different name as a starter theme, a boilerplate for developing themes for Bludit CMS. It still is is considered by its developer to be a starter theme however it now has many presentation options and the theme can be used for a simple yet attractive blog, or a small brochure site.

## Configuration

This theme requires its companion plugin to be installed. Find this at [https://github.com/Bludiot/configureight-plugin](https://github.com/Bludiot/configureight-plugin).

## Compatibility

Configure 8 has been tested on Bludit version 3.15.0, running PHP 8.2.4. The minimum PHP version required is PHP 7.4. The standard plugin hooks are provided.

### Bludit Version 4

Some version-compare steps have been taken to make this theme compatible with Bludit 4.0 but it is not ready. And from the looks of the activity on the development repository, v4 is a long way off.

### RTL Languages

Direction and layout styles for right-to-left languages are implemented automatically when an RTL language is set in the site settings.

## Page Templates

Several page template options are built into the theme, which can be employed in the page edit screen under Options > Advanced. More than one template may be used at once, with space between each template slug, depending on the template type.

Templates (slugs) includeâ€¦

- Full screen cover image (full-cover)
- No sidebar (no-sidebar)
- Bottom sidebar (sidebar-bottom)
- Static front page (used automatically)
- About page (about)
- Contact page (contact)

### Color Schemes

Several color schemes are provided, including dark versions for dark user preference, which can be used by editing the configuration file.

### Typography

Several font schemes are provided, which can be used by editing the configuration file.

All font files have variable weights.
