## Overview

The Configure 8 theme began under a different name as a starter theme, a boilerplate for developing themes for Bludit CMS. It still is is considered by its developer to be a starter theme however it now has many presentation options and the theme can be used for a simple yet attractive blog, or a small brochure site.

The code is hosted on GitHub as a public template so one can use it to begin building their own themes upon the Configure 8 base.

## Page Templates

Several page template options are built into the theme, which can be employed in the page edit screen under Options > Advanced. More than one template may be used at once, with space between each template slug, depending on the template type.

- Full screen cover image (full-cover)
- No sidebar (no-sidebar)
- Bottom sidebar (sidebar-bottom)
- Static front page (used automatically)
- About page (about)
- Contact page (contact)

## Configuration
